# Shell-Scripting

## why Shell-Scripting?
* Avoid repetetive work
* Keep history
* Share the instructions
* Logic and bulk operations

## How ?
Write commands in file 
execute the file
such file => shell script with `.sh` extension

## Shell ?
Program => interpreting and executing various commands that we type in terminal.
 
 ## Terminal?
 Terminal is what make you able to write commands in the shell.
 
 * sh => Bourne shell
 * bash ==> bourne again shell - /bin/bash
  * improved version of sh

# SheBang
All script have extensions like `.sh`, `.zsh`, etc. so to tell os what to use to run the script we write on the first line of the script `#!bin/bash` for bash or `#!/bin/sh` for sh

Also for a python script we use `./bin/python3`.

# execution
to execute a script we type `./script.sh` 

always make sure to check you have proper permission (can be changed by using chmod).
